Simple CRUD program For IBM using React

this is a to do list in react. i made this simple project to show my ability to use CRUD in react. so using the app
You can add new tasks to the list, The app usually displays tasks in a list format, allowing you to see them at a glance. You can modify existing tasks by changing their details, marking them as completed, or deleting them.

After I set up the project and install all needed dependencies, 
i created the components.

in app.js file i imported TodoWrapper component. 
TodoForm.js - this component handles the creating new task. 
Todo.js - This component will represent a single task. in the todo.js created a component that renders single task, used FontAwesomeIcon for the icon of edit and delete
TodoWrapper.js - This component will render the list of tasks. in the TodoWrapper Component i imported the other needed components.
EditTodoForm - This component will edit and delete list of task
TodoWrapperLocalStorage.js this components manage the list of task and provide functions such as toggle complete, add, delete and edit functions.

after long testing finally run the app in the development server.
